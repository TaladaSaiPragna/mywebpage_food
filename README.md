Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website is about few cuisines. Index page is the home page of my website. There are four different html pages linked with
the homepage. These four different pages describes about four different cuisines. There are images in all the pages. There is
a table in thehome page describing about famous foods in four different countries. In the pages like Indian,Chineses, italian 
and american there are flex boxes which gets adjusted according to the screen size.
 
 All the five pages are interlinked with each other. We can navigate from one page to any other page.
  In index page I used a Carousel style of bootstrap which is used to design slides of images.
  In some pages I used flex box to place images. In this flex box images gets adjusted in one column when screen size is large
   and columns gets adjusted according to screen size.
